'''
6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the
name of a pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s
name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list
and as you do print everything you know about each pet.
