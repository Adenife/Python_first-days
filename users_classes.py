'''
Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user. Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.

Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from Exercise 9-3 (page 166). Write a method called increment_login_attempts()
that increments the value of login_attempts by 1. Write another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.
Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
properly, and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
'''
'''Privileges: Write a separate Privileges class. The class should have one attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7.
Move the show_privileges() method to this class. Make a Privileges instance as an attribute in the Admin class. Create a new instance of Admin and use your
method to show its privileges.
